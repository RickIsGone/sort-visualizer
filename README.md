# Introduction  
this is an app i made to show how different sorting algorithms work  

# The sorting algorithms  
The algorithms used in the app are:  
* Quick sort
* Bubble sort  
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Bogo sort
* Miracle sort
    
# Time complexity

# Important note
The time the visualizer takes to order the list doesn't properly rappresent the speed of the algorithm, if you want to know the actual average time complexity read [Time complexity](#Time-complexity)
